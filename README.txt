Tetris

In this classic puzzle game, blocks drop from the top of the game board and you must arrange them so that they form solid lines. The lines will be cleared once you get them. Clearing 4 of these solid lines at once is called a Tetris. The game gets faster the more lines you clear. You play until your pile of uncleared blocks reaches the top of the game board.

Use the left, right, and down arrow keys to move the current shape in play left, right, or down faster. 
Use the Space Key for a hard drop.
Use the H key to hold the current shape in play for later and go on to the next one. Holding a shape when you already have a held shape will swap out your held shape for the one in play.

Tetris

In this classic puzzle game, blocks drop from the top of the game board and you must arrange them so that they form solid lines. The lines will be cleared once you get them. Clearing 4 of these solid lines at once is called a Tetris. The game gets faster the more lines you clear. You play until your pile of uncleared blocks reaches the top of the game board.
